# Watchout
Most things in this repo will work with any number of inputs except the following:
    scrolling on click - this is currently hardcoded
    also all my resources are on s3 so one would need to add their own links, and update to view changes
        - resumes
        - pictures
        -bundle file
    Plus side of using hosting the media on s3 is that I only had to push to my github.io once and 
    now I only update the S3 for any changes and they render immediately
